About Shortlisting

        After you receive interest from tradesmen, the next step is to shortlist those you would like to speak with.
        Shortlisting exchanges phone numbers and allows you both to send messages through the site. You can also decline a tradesman's interest, and we will politely let them know.

Kind regards,

The team at DodgyBuilder (http://www.dodgybuilder.com/?)
